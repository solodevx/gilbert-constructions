# Gilbert Constructions Website

## Project Status
This project is currently in a **clean setup** using **Next.js 14** and **Tailwind CSS v3**.  
It does **not** use the latest Next.js 16 or Tailwind 4 features, because this setup ensures stability for current development and avoids potential TurboPack issues.

## Branches
- `main`: previous setup (older project version)
- `clean-setup`: current stable version (this branch)

## Notes
- The project is optimized for practice and experimentation.
- Mobile and tablet layouts are being refined; some small screen responsiveness is pending.
- Custom fonts are loaded via Google Fonts using Next.js font optimization.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
