# Project Notes - GILBERT'S CONSTRUCTIONS

## Project Setup Decisions
- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- No `src/` directory
- ESLint enabled for code quality
- Git used for version control

## Dependencies Installed
- **framer-motion** → animations (sections, cards, hero, hover effects)
- **react-countup** → animated stats / numbers
- **react-icons** → icons (FontAwesome, Heroicons, etc.)
- **swiper** → sliders / carousels (projects, testimonials)
- **tailwindcss-animate** → extra animation utilities for Tailwind

> Note: React already included by Next.js, no need to reinstall.
